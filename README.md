# Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study

## Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone

This case study serves as the capstone requirement for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. In this project, I assumed the role of a junior data analyst working for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago. Since its inception in 2016, Cyclistic has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

Cyclistic has two types of customers, customers who purchase single ride are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

In order to increase revenue, the company wants to come up with a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.

The analysis will follow the 6 phases of the Data Analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Act (APPAA).
