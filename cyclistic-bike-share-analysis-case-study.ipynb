In this project, I assumed the role of a junior data analyst working for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company based in Chicago.

Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.\n\nIn order to increase revenue, the company wants to come up with a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.\nThe analysis will follow the 6 phases of the Data Analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, and Act (APPAA).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Ask phase:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In an effort to grow the company, the Marketing department, led by Lily Moreno, wants to come up with a creative marketing strategy that leads to convert the casual riders to annual subscribers.\n\nI have been assigned to analyze the way that the annual members and casual riders use our application differently.\n\nData-driven insight into the trends should help the Marketing department to plan the most effective marketing strategy using the digital media that makes the casual users of Cyclistic buy an annual membership.\n\nAt the end of the analysis, I will include some recommendations that try to achieve the goal of growing the company by increasing the annual subscribers.

That means they don't use it as Cyclistic members for the commute.\n\nAn annual subscription system may call it (Summer+) or similar names, seeks to satisfy casual and new clients, based on the idea of exploiting the high demand in summer and its decline in winter. This subscription is a package of offers, which satisfy the potential subscriber and at the same time guarantee his annual subscription:\n\n1- Decreasing the annual subscription fees by 30-40%, with free rides during the bike rides season, which is from May to October.\n\n2- During the rest of the year, which is from November to April, the member with Summer+ will have to pay per ride, but with a discount of 10-15% than the casual riders.\n\nThis will provide a feeling for the members that they don't pay fees for a not fully used service and at the same time give the member advantage over the casual riders.\n\n3- Give the member an option to select two road lines for free the whole year, whether summer or winter.
